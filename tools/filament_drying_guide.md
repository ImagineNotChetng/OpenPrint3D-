# Filament Drying Guide

Proper drying of filament is essential for achieving high-quality 3D prints. Moisture in filament causes bubbling, stringing, poor layer adhesion, and surface defects.

## Recommended Drying Times & Temperatures

| Material | Temperature | Time (Spool) | Time (If Wet) | Notes |
|----------|-------------|--------------|---------------|-------|
| **PLA** | 40-45°C | 4-6 hours | 8-12 hours | Most forgiving; lower temp to prevent softening |
| **PETG** | 60-65°C | 4-6 hours | 8-12 hours | Slightly higher temp needed |
| **ABS** | 70-80°C | 4-6 hours | 8-12 hours | Higher temp to ensure proper drying |
| **ASA** | 70-80°C | 4-6 hours | 8-12 hours | Similar to ABS |
| **Nylon** | 70-80°C | 8-12 hours | 12-24 hours | Very hygroscopic; needs longer drying |
| **PC (Polycarbonate)** | 80-100°C | 6-8 hours | 12-24 hours | High temp drying required |
| **PEEK** | 120-150°C | 4-6 hours | 8-12 hours | Very high temp material |
| **TPU** | 45-55°C | 2-4 hours | 6-8 hours | Lower temp to avoid melting |
| **PVB** | 50-60°C | 4-6 hours | 8-12 hours | Handle with care; can be brittle when wet |
| **CPE** | 60-65°C | 4-6 hours | 8-12 hours | Similar to PETG |
| **PP (Polypropylene)** | 70-80°C | 6-8 hours | 12-24 hours | Requires high temp + longer time |
| **POM (Delrin)** | 70-80°C | 4-6 hours | 8-12 hours | Prone to warping if wet |
| **PMMA (Acrylic)** | 60-70°C | 4-6 hours | 8-12 hours | Can crack if dried too fast |

## General Guidelines

- **Storage**: Always store opened filament with desiccant or in airtight containers
- **Signs of wet filament**: Popping/bubbling during extrusion, stringing, poor surface finish
- **Maximum spool temperature**: Check manufacturer specs—some spools have temperature limits
- **Dry box printing**: For very hygroscopic materials (Nylon, PEEK, PC), consider printing from a dry box

## Drying Methods

### Print Dryer Box
- Dedicated devices with heating elements and fans
- Most effective; typically 1-2 hours for partial drying

### Oven
- Use convection oven for even heat distribution
- Monitor temperature carefully; too high can damage spool
- Leave oven door slightly ajar for ventilation

### Food Dehydrator
- Good alternative with low temp control
- May not reach high enough temps for PC/PEEK

## Quick Reference

```
Highly Hygroscopic (>8h):  Nylon, PC, PEEK, PP
Moderately Hygroscopic (4-8h): PETG, ABS, ASA, CPE, POM
Less Hygroscopic (2-4h):    PLA, TPU, PVB
