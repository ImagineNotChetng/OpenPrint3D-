## Maintenance Tips

### PEI Surfaces
- Clean with isopropyl alcohol (70-90%) between prints
- Avoid abrasive cleaners or metal tools
- For stubborn residue, use acetone sparingly (smooth PEI only)
- Replace when significant scratches affect adhesion

### Glass
- Clean with glass cleaner or IPA
- Apply fresh adhesion aid before each print
- Avoid thermal shock - let cool before removing prints
- Check for chips or cracks regularly

### BuildTak
- Clean with IPA or mild soap and water
- Avoid scraping with metal tools
- Light sanding (220 grit) can refresh surface
- Replace when adhesion becomes inconsistent

### Kapton Tape
- Replace when bubbles, tears, or residue appear
- Apply to clean, warm bed for best adhesion
- Overlap edges slightly for complete coverage
- Use credit card to smooth out bubbles

### Powder-Coated
- Clean with IPA or warm soapy water
- Use plastic scraper only
- Flex plate to remove stubborn prints
- Durable surface requires minimal maintenance

## Troubleshooting

### Prints Not Sticking

1. **Clean the surface** - Oils from hands reduce adhesion
2. **Check Z-offset** - First layer too high = poor adhesion
3. **Increase bed temp** - Add 5-10°C
4. **Slow first layer** - 20-30mm/s for better bonding
5. **Add brim** - Increases contact area
6. **Apply adhesion aid** - Gluestick, hairspray, or ABS slurry

### Prints Sticking Too Well

1. **Wait for cool down** - Most surfaces release when cold
2. **Use release layer** - Gluestick on PEI for PETG
3. **Lower bed temp** - Reduce by 5-10°C
4. **Use textured surface** - Easier release than smooth
5. **Flex plate** - Spring steel allows bending to release

### Uneven Adhesion

1. **Level the bed** - Critical for consistent adhesion
2. **Check surface flatness** - Glass or aluminum may warp
3. **Clean entire surface** - Not just print area
4. **Adjust Z-offset per region** - Some surfaces need compensation

### Surface Damage

1. **Stop using metal tools** - Switch to plastic scrapers
2. **Avoid excessive force** - Flex or cool to remove parts
3. **Don't scrape PEI** - Let it release naturally
4. **Replace when necessary** - Damaged surfaces cause failed prints
