# OpenPrint3D — An Open, Slicer-Independent Profile Format

OpenPrint3D is an open proposal for standardizing printer, filament, and process profiles in a simple, neutral JSON format.
It’s designed to make 3D-printing configurations easier to share, easier to maintain, and easier for tools or slicers to import — without replacing or competing with existing slicers.

This project began independently before the announcement of Prusa’s OpenPrintTag, but the two efforts are naturally complementary:
OpenPrintTag focuses on spool/tag metadata, while OpenPrint3D focuses on the configuration layer behind those materials.

The goal is a lightweight, community-driven framework that reduces fragmentation and provides a clean, consistent foundation for anyone building slicer tooling, print-farm systems, material libraries, or automation.

OpenPrint3D is currently an early-stage draft (schema v0.1). Feedback, discussion, and contributions are welcome.
